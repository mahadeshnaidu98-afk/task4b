# task4b
You are tasked with creating a Python program that showcases operations on tuples. Tuples are immutable sequences, similar to lists but with the key difference that they cannot be changed after creation. Your program should illustrate the following tuple operations:
tuple=(10,'hello',3.14,'world')
print(tuple)
for i in tuple:
 print(i)
print(tuple[1:3])
print(tuple[:-1])
t2=(5,0.5)
t3=tuple+t2
print(t3)
tuple[3]="pi"
